## Overview

The **Lending Club Loan Prediction** project explores a dataset of Lending Club loans to:

- Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for loan outcome prediction.
- Provide insights into the factors influencing loan repayment.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning to solve financial risk analysis problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.


## Project Description

The **Lending Club Loan Prediction** notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features for better model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Examine borrower attributes and loan performance.
   - Visualize trends and correlations using graphs and charts.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Identify key risk factors affecting loan outcomes.
   - Provide actionable insights for lenders to minimize defaults.

### Applications

- Risk assessment for financial institutions.
- Data-driven decision-making for loan approvals.
- Educational resource for learning classification techniques in machine learning.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
